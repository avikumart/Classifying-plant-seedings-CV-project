# Classifying-plant-seedings-CV-project
In this repo, I have share complete repository of image classification project to classify plant seedings using tensorflow and keras

## **ðŸ§­ Problem Statement:**

Build an image classifier which will classify the images of plant seedlings.

## **Steps taken to build Image classifier:**

1) We loaded the dataset and assigned numerical labels to each images

2) We converted images into numpy arrays to build neural network model

3) We developed NN model and trained using data augmentation

4) Tested model on test dataset and inference using predict() method.
